			`I am a proficient Full-Stack Developer with a solid foundation in computer science, holding a Master of Science degree from Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi and a Bachelor of Technology from the Indian Institute of Information Technology SriCity. With extensive experience spanning from 2018 to the present, I have expertise in all phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), specializing in the design, development, and optimization of Spring applications and ReactJS-based full-stack web applications.
			
			Throughout my career, I have made significant contributions to the enhancement of user interfaces, leading to a 25% improvement in user experience, and have played a pivotal role in the architecture and implementation of REST-based Microservices using Spring Boot and Spring Data with JPA. My efforts have streamlined deployment and development workflows through the integration of continuous integration tools like Jenkins.
			
			My leadership skills were quickly recognized at Thingks Infomatics, where I assumed a critical role in project management within six months, driving advancements in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. Additionally, as the leader of the Toastmasters club at Thingks Infomatics, I have been instrumental in fostering a culture of open dialogue and professional growth among peers.
			
			A strong proponent of best practices in code development and review, I have effectively reduced system loading times by 30% and enhanced performance across various devices, resulting in a 30% increase in user engagement and a 10% increase in revenue. His technical skills are broad and comprehensive, including C, C++, Java, ReactJS, Python, and AWS services, among others.
			
			My academic projects showcase my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical applications, with notable projects in outlier detection, location-based alarm systems, public transportation routing, and signature-based IDS systems for IoT networks. My dedication to technological advancement and my leadership in both professional and academic settings mark me as a distinguished individual in the field of Computer Science and Software Development.`,
